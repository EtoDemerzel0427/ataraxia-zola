# Ataraxia

A personal theme for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) focused on readability that aims to be simple, beautiful, and modern. It is designed to support multiple languages and be highly customizable.

The theme takes visual inspiration from the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) and [Neumorphism](https://github.com/longpdo/neumorphism) themes.

## Installation

Open a command terminal at your site path and run:

```console
cd themes

```

## Configuration

Copy the `config_sample.toml` file to your site's main path, then rename it to `config.toml` and edit it with your site data.

You can display the result of your website by running:
